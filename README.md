Best practices:
  use method with following signature
  to easy switch between online, offline input mode
    void solve(istream& cin, ostream& cout);


Problems to revise:
SPOJ/RHOMBS
  solution is very easy. but idea should be explained.
  there are probably some geometrical rules involved.
SPOJ/MATCHING
  Hopcroft-Karp should be learnt and put into Ant library.
