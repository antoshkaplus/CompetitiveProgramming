"""Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P{n}=n*(3*n-1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 - 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference is pentagonal and D = |Pk - Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?"""def binary_search(a,x,lo=0,hi=None):  if hi is None:      hi = len(a)  while lo < hi:      mid = (lo+hi)//2      midval = a[mid]      if midval < x:          lo = mid+1      elif midval > x:           hi = mid      else:          return mid  return 0pns = [1,5,12]D = 10**7i = 1while pns[i+1]-pns[i] < D:  print i  j = i+1    while True:     sum = pns[j]+pns[i]    dif = pns[j]-pns[i]    if dif > pns[j-1]: break    while pns[-1] < sum: pns.append(2*pns[-1]-pns[-2]+3)          if binary_search(pns[j+1:],sum) and binary_search(pns[:j],dif) and D > dif:       D = dif         j+=1      i+=1  if i == len(pns)-1: pns.append(2*pns[-1]-pns[-2]+3)    print D
